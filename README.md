# QR-Code-Generator
This a QR Code Generator application made using Python and GUI. Student details can be encrypted in a QR Code by using this application.
I have used Tkinter to make a GUI window and various packages like Pillow, ResizeImage.
While using this application, you have to insert data in every field to generate a QR code successfully. It's advantage is that, it downloads the QR Code as PNG file while generating it. You can scan the code and fetch the proper data that is being inserted.

When A QR Code is generated:
